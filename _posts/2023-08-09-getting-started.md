## What is the Natas Wargame?
***
Natas teaches the basics of serverside cybersecurity through practical application in a 'capture the flag' style game, and the player, or attacker, learns how to certain mechanics of web security are used and possible vulnerabilities.

### How Does the Wargame work?
***
Each level of natas consists of its own website located at `http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org`, where X is the level number. There is no SSH login. To access a level, you enter the username for that level (e.g. `natas0` for level 0) and its password. Each level has access to the password of the next level. The objective is to somehow obtain that next password and level up, and there are no restrictions to what you can do to infiltrate the webpage to obtain the password through bypassing security measures.
